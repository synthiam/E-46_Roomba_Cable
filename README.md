This is the reference design for a cable that you can attach your robot controller to a Roomba's SCI Port. The Roomba SCI port requires a Male 7-pin mini DIN connector which is provided by E-46. This Roomba cable breaks out power into a 2.1mm barrel Plug, and UART TX/RX/GND to a 4-position male dupont connector. The power output from the SCI port is limited to 200mA by a PTC fuse within the Roomba but is more than enough to power most microcontrollers (i.e. EZ-Bs). 

A unique feature of this cable is that it has the Roomba SCI wires are broken out to common interface plugs (2.1mm Barrel and Dupont). This gives the Roomba the ability to plug and play right away with external microcontroller boards with no soldering required. 

**Please Note:** The voltage on the barrel plug is unregulated voltage from the 14.4V Roomba battery which can be up to 18V fully charged.
