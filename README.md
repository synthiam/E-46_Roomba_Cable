# E-46 Roomba Cable

This is the reference design for a cable that you can attach to your roomba's SCI Port. The Roomba SCI port requires a 7-pin mini DIN connector which is provided by E-46. This Roomba cable breaks out power into a barrel Plug, and UART TX, UART RX, and GND to a 4-position male dupont connector. The power output from the SCI port is limited to 200mA by a PTC fuse within the Roomba. The voltage on the barrel plug is unregulated voltage from the 14.4V Roomba battery (can be up to 18V fully charged).
